# JavaScript Variables and Operators

## Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. They are declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword.

- `var` is the traditional way of declaring variables. It has function scope.
- `let` allows you to declare block-scoped variables. It's commonly used when the variable's value will change.
- `const` is used for variables whose value will not change throughout the program. It also has block scope.

Example:
```javascript
var age = 25;
let name = "John";
const PI = 3.14;
