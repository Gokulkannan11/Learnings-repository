    **Declaring a Variable:**
    
    To declare a variable in Java, any of these three keywords can be used along with a variable name:
    
    - The data type.
    - The variable name.
    - The value.
    
    ```java
    int age = 28;
    char grade = 'A';
    boolean late = true;
    byte b = 20;
    long num1 = 1234567;
    short no = 10;
    float k = (float)12.5;
    double pi = 3.14;
    
    ```
